        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What should I consider before adopting a dog?</strong>
            <span>Consider your lifestyle, the space in your home, and whether you have time to dedicate to the dogs care and training. Also, assess your financial situation, as owning a dog involves expenses for food, healthcare, and other necessities.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What type of dog is best suited for my family?</strong>
            <span>It depends on your environment and lifestyle. Smaller, low-energy breeds may be suitable for apartments, while larger, more active dogs may need a home with outdoor space and an owner who enjoys outdoor activities.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What should I expect during the adoption process?</strong>
            <span>The adoption process may include filling out forms, interviews, and in some cases, a home visit to ensure it is a suitable environment for the dog. You may also need to pay an adoption fee.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What does the adoption fee include?</strong>
            <span>The fee typically covers spaying/neutering, vaccinations, microchipping, and sometimes an initial veterinary checkup. This fee helps cover the shelters operational costs.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How can I prepare my home for the arrival of a dog?</strong>
            <span>Make sure you have basic supplies: a bed, food and water bowls, a leash, a collar, and toys. Designate a safe and comfortable space for the dog to feel secure upon arrival.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What should I do during the first few days with my new dog?</strong>
            <span>Allow your dog to adjust to its new environment at its own pace. Establish a routine for feeding, walks, and rest. Be patient as it starts to acclimate and get to know its new home.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How do I introduce an adopted dog to other pets in the home?</strong>
            <span>Introduce them gradually in a controlled environment. Keep both animals on a leash initially and observe their behavior. Supervise all interactions until you are confident they get along well.</span>
